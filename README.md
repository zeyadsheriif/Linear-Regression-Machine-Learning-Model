# Linear-Regression-Machine-Learning-Model
The Project Consists of 3 parts:

Part1 [Prediction]:

1-Define any linear equation of one variable (e.g. y = 3x+2)

2-Select 5 different values for x (x1, x2, ... x10) and calculate corresponding y values

3-Use x and y values as training data, apply MSSE technique to obtain the equation of the line that best fit on the training data (compare to your defined equation)

4-Repeat 1, 2, and 3 after adding random noise term to the equation (e.g. y = 3x+2 + random(0..1))

Part2 [Classification]:

1-Use IRIS dataset, group samples of class 2 and class 3 together to form new class (Class II)

2-Split Class I samples into 40 samples for train and 10 samples for test

3-Split Class II samples into 80 samples for train and 20 samples for test

4-Train your linear classifier model using Least Squares Technique (MSSE). Let your model output be Positive for Class I and Negative for Others. This model is suitable to classify the input sample as Class I or “Other classes”

5-Use your trained model to classify test samples (into either Class I or Class II)

Part3 [Classification]:

1-Use IRIS dataset, and use the approach which is called “One vs All”

2-Split Class I samples into 40 samples for train and 10 samples for test

3-Split Class II samples into 40 samples for train and 10 samples for test

4-Split Class III samples into 40 samples for train and 10 samples for test

5-Train your linear classifier model using Least Squares Technique (MSSE). Let your model output be Positive for Class I and Negative for Others. This model is suitable to classify the input sample as Class I or “Other classes”

6-Use your trained model to classify test samples (into either Class I or Class II)

7-train two other models to classify IRIS class 2 and IRIS class 3.
